    '''
    Maps the two input features to quadratic features.
        
    Returns a new feature array with d features, comprising of
        X1, X2, X1 ** 2, X2 ** 2, X1*X2, X1*X2 ** 2, ... up to the 6th power polynomial
        
    Arguments:
        X1 is an n-by-1 column matrix
        X2 is an n-by-1 column matrix
    Returns:
        an n-by-d matrix, where each row represents the new features of the corresponding instance
